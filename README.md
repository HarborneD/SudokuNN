# SudokuNN
A web based neural net implementation that reads a sudoku grid publish from the guardian and solves it.

Training data is purely based from the guardian and thus is not compatible with other sources. 

Training is not fully finished as the segmenting algorithem has recently changed

Other ML stragies search as a ConvNet would work more reliably but the neural network backing this solution has had decent results as is.
